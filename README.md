SPARCLab at City, University of London

SPARCLab (SPARCL for short) is a new system for immersive sound, image, and movement based in the Department of Performing Arts at City, University London and its research centre SPARC https://sparc.london/ funded by an AHRC CResCa (Creative Research Capability) grant led by Aaron Einbond with collaborators Erik Nystrom, Stephen Cottrell, Will Goring, and Joshua Mitchell.
